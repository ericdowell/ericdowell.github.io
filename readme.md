# Eric Dowell Personal Site
Build: [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/ericdowell/ericdowell.github.io.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/ericdowell/ericdowell.github.io)

This is my personal website, it is generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and
the build process is tested via [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/). It's hosted via
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and runs through [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

If you'd like to learn how to setup a [Github Page](https://pages.github.com/) and
run it through [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) then you can follow
