# Eric Dowell Personal Site
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/ericdowell/ericdowell.github.io.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/ericdowell/ericdowell.github.io)

This is the source for my [personal website](https://ericdowell.com), it is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
which is provided by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I setup a build process via [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)
to test that everything is working before I merge any code to be deployed. To make the site is fast and that my site does
not hit the [Github Pages soft bandwidth limit](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/#usage-limits)
I use [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) as my CDN.

If you'd like to learn how to setup a [Github Page](https://pages.github.com/) and
run it through [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) then you can follow
this [blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/).
